1
00:00:00,699 --> 00:00:04,479
where is the Slime Lord

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:10,639
how foolish that you think me an ally

3
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,232
I don't seek your allegiance

4
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:17,192
I seek the Lord of the Slime

5
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:21,712
you mock me Light-bringer

6
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:28,752
you come to my prison and ask for a favor

7
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:31,178
you chose this cell the day

8
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,638
you turn to the Jeremys against the king

9
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:37,244
the Shard affords you much knowledge

10
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,084
yet you know so little

11
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:45,084
I'm not here to adjudicate the past

12
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:51,524
I'm here because at present the Slime Lord threatens all I hold dear

13
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:55,186
and you seek my sympathy

14
00:00:56,086 --> 00:01:02,906
all I hold dear exists beyond the veil that I cannot penetrate

15
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:08,946
even the shadows no longer answer to me

16
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:11,914
you gave him the Shadow Stone

17
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,619
he is a demon

18
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,132
Gorlock

19
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,339
you must tell me where he is

20
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,939
the Slime Lord threatens all within the realm of light

21
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,499
including that which you hold dear

22
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:31,312
the shadows may bind you now Golock

23
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:34,752
but there is still fire within you

24
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:36,312
I know it

25
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:39,397
it burns for Maywynn

26
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:41,512
wherever she dwells

27
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:47,472
you took her from me when you locked me in this dungeon

28
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:50,824
the Slime™️ consumes all Gorlock

29
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:52,584
it is indiscriminate

30
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:56,215
it swallows up all within its path

31
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,784
and then it devours the light

32
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:03,007
you're using her to trick me

33
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,944
just like he did

34
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:09,424
Slimelord promised you Maywynn

35
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:12,785
he said if I gave him the stone

36
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:18,105
he would open a door between the realms of light and shadow

37
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,025
that I may feel her warmth again

38
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:24,705
but it was a lie

39
00:02:25,165 --> 00:02:28,785
I am fighting for the same realm your heart longs for

40
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:31,145
please help me

41
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:34,385
he already has the heart of Asloendrath

42
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,465
and now he has the Shadow Stone

43
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:38,905
and he's 3 days ahead of us

44
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:42,385
three days

45
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,313
he took the stone from me

46
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:49,225
seven years ago

47
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:52,626
that's impossible

48
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:59,778
he is a demon
