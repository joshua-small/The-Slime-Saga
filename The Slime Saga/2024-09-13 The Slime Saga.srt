1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,660
the slime gate must be closed

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,420
I believe it is in the interest of the High Council

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,460
of the Order of the Shard that it be sealed immediately

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,940
all in favor say aye

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,680
aye

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,700
aye

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,580
nay

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,620
what brings you here Slime Lord

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,940
last I checked I am a member of this council

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,420
you forfeited your seat the moment you refused to sign the accords

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,340
I'll sign the accords once I've set my peace

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,900
he is a traitor

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,420
he has no place on this council

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,740
the Shard demands of us understanding

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,700
allow the man to speak

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,340
speak now Slime Lord

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,300
then be gone from this place

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,060
the Slime Gate cannot be closed without the talisman

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,820
and last I checked it resides within the Shadow Realm

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,000
with the full resources of the Pork Watch on our side

21
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,060
we shall acquire the Shadow Stone

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,180
there may be no trust between us

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,960
but surely

24
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:16,300
this council is not so foolish as to tarry with the Shadow Lord himself

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,420
we can handle Gorlock

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,420
allow me to speak to Gorlock

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,940
we have a storied history

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,380
and perhaps I can restore some of the good will between us

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,180
surely you cannot be considering this arrangement

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,425
he is the Slime Lord

31
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:47,340
he seeks to keep the slime gate open

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,220
merely because he draws his power from the slime

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,940
what will it be High Councilman

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,284
will you start a war with Gorlock

35
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:02,020
or take a chance on a man of the slime
