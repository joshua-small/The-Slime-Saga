1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,780
The High Council of the Shard was tasked with keeping peace within the realm

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,340
and yet there is turmoil

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,180
not just in our kingdom

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,060
but within the council itself

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,260
if you are troubled, Brother Ormid

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,740
allow your fellow councilmen to bear your load

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,740
I was approached by Thorranbarth of the Porkwatch

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,420
regarding the dealings of the Slimeguard

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,140
he suspects there are misdeeds within the council

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,420
and now I fear there is mistrust between us and the Watch

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,820
as long as the Lord of Slime sits on this council

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,340
our morals will be compromised

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,540
I fear that Brother Tyrrill is correct

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,080
we've not heard a word from Slimelord

15
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:56,300
since we sent him to the Shadow Realm to negotiate with Gorlock

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,402
we have no reason to believe that the Slimeguard did not act of their own accord

17
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:05,700
and given that the crown of Elgnar still sits safely within Borgan's Tower

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,260
I believe we must give Slimelord a chance to prove his allegiance

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,180
I now fear that my efforts to keep peace within the council

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,660
have caused greater chaos within the realm

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,820
the council must not rest until Slimelord is located

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,420
fortune smiles upon us that he did not procure the Crown of Elgnar

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,140
but how long will it be before the Slimeguard strikes again

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,980
in search of other ancient relics

25
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,381
I fear you are right brother

26
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:41,861
if Slimelord has truly returned to his dark ways

27
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:44,581
it won't be long before the realm is lost

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,020
I sense great sorrow within you

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,300
Brother Braythwaite

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,140
this is not the way of the Shard

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,980
it never was

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,260
the Shard demands understanding

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,740
but it also demands peace

34
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,500
and we shall see no peace

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,420
until Slimelord answers for the actions of the Slimeguard

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,100
then our path is clear dear brothers

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,460
we must go to the shadow realm

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,340
it should be me

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm the one who started all of this 

40
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:34,263
when I chose to trust the Slimelord
