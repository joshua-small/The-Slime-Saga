1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:04,407
last night at three bells past the twilight hour

2
00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:08,827
a lone guardsman of the Porkwatch intercepted three men

3
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:11,087
attempting to steal the Crown of Elgnar

4
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:15,331
have the perpetrators been identified

5
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:21,651
markings on their robes indicate an affiliation with the Slimeguard

6
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,767
this can be seen as nothing but an act of aggression from the Slime Lord himself

7
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,411
we don't know that Tyrrill

8
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,411
and we will not jump to conclusions

9
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:33,711
they are members of the Slimeguard

10
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:36,651
they act at the behest of Slimelord

11
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:39,651
it is possible they act of their own accord

12
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:43,131
how can you be so quick to defend him

13
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:46,531
he has no place on this council

14
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:48,411
Braythwaite is right

15
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:51,710
it is possible they were not sent by Slimelord

16
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:54,131
surely you can't be serious

17
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:57,031
we sent him to negotiate with Gorlock

18
00:00:57,032 --> 00:01:00,611
we've heard nothing and now he's come for the Crown

19
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:04,891
we will wait for the Porkwatch to conduct their investigation

20
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:07,451
before we jump to any conclusions

21
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:09,371
I agree with Ormid

22
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:13,011
for all we know Slime Lord is with Gorlock right now

23
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,753
negotiating for the release of the Shadow Stone

24
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:17,671
mark my words

25
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:19,551
while you wait for the Porkwatch

26
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:23,011
Slimelord will execute a second attack

27
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:25,801
I choose to believe he is a man of his word

28
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,869
he's a man of The Slimeâ„¢

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,009
nothing more

30
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,809
I am in alignment with Braythwait

31
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:38,209
we will give him a chance to prove his allegiance

32
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,209
how can you do this

33
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,929
how can you continue to believe in him

34
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:51,482
because I am human

35
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,590
and I believe every man has a right

36
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,129
to his humanity

37
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:01,166
with all due respect, counselman

38
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:03,646
in my experience

39
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,632
Slimelord is no man
