1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,780
can these records be trusted

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,620
the Porkchives are the most comprehensive vault of knowledge in all the land

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,860
I assure you, High Councilman Ormid hails from the Slime Realm

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,660
surely a man born among The Slime™️ is not certainly a man of The Slime™️

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,740
who appointed Slimelord to the High Council of the Shard

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,780
Ormid

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,500
then we know where his allegiance lies

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,420
but think of all the good the Council has done under his guidance

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,912
it's been twelve years

10
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:43,700
surely if he was a man of The Slime™️

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,780
we would have seen through his guise

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,980
or perhaps he's biting his time until his plan unfurls

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,740
as we speak the Slimeguard is poised to strike

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,480
if Slimelord's been to the Shadow Realm

15
00:00:56,481 --> 00:01:01,140
as you said he may now possess two of the Nether-Gems

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,540
what about the Blade

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,860
has the Porkwatch increased security

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,660
it's far from the city by now

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,500
Captain Greythorn is aboard the Porkaft in the Western Sea

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,860
and is taking the Blade to an unmarked island alone

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,020
I sent twp porkmen with him

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,580
Norgis and Fillik

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,900
they're good lads

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,840
good

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,460
Plaraxat help us all if the Slimeguard gets their hands on the Vlade

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,460
the Porkraft seems to be faring well tonight

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,580
Omnes Ad Porcos, Bother Norgis

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,860
she is a fine vessel

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,700
even in her old age

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,540
that she is Captain

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,900
I trust Fillik as fallen fast asleep

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,620
yes Captain

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,860
the waves have rocked him to sleep like a baby

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,520
ah well

35
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,550
he's earned it

36
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,980
and you should tuck in too Norgis

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,269
we sail at first light

38
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,180
once the Blade has been locked away

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,740
alright captain

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,260
the ocean's black is ink tonight isn't it

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,660
no one will find us out here

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,060
that's the plan brother

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,820
that's the plan
