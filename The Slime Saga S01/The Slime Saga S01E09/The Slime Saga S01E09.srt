1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,080
after the Porkwatch intercepted members of the Slimeguard

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:06,300
attempting to steal the Crown of Elgnar

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,240
I met with Brother Ormid

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,900
of the High Council of the Shard to express my concerns

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,820
Brother Ormid is a man of honour

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,380
I have no doubt he was cooperative and receptive to your concerns

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,580
that's the thing, Captain

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,600
as far as I'm aware Brother Ormid

9
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:27,740
has made no effort to remove Slimelord from the High Council of the Shard

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,440
do you believe Slimelord is not worthy of a seat on the Council

11
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:32,420
Thorranbarth

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
you know as well as me, Captain

13
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,980
that he draws his power from The Slime™️

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,060
and the Slime Gate to this day remains open

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,340
and in the light of the recent actions of the Slimeguard

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,060
I don't see how we can trust the High Council of the Shard

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,180
given that the Slimelord sits among them

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,760
the men of the Shard have done more for this realm than

19
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:55,760
all the men of the pork combined

20
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:58,700
and that includes you Thorranbarth

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,540
so I'd ask that you choose your words wisely

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,780
I don't trust the Lord of the Slime

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,260
and as long as he sits on the Council of the Shard

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,060
I don't trust the Council either

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,740
these are incendiary words Thorranbarth

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,660
that they are, Captain

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,880
but what choice do I have

28
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,940
when I'm watching my kingdom burn

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,220
do you mean to tell me the Slimeguard struck again

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,800
last night they descended upon the temple and seized

31
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,820
the Heart of Asloendrath

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,620
the Crown

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,200
the Heart

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,020
it won't be long before they come for the Blade

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,460
and then the Slimeguard will be completely unstoppable

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,260
very well

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,500
assemble the Porkmen and tell the Blade-Keeper to move it to my ship

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,620
we must get the Blade as far from the city as possible

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,180
lest the Slimeguard strike again tonight

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,380
thank you, Captain

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,520
I believe that by acting now

42
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:16,300
we can stop this before the kingdom is completely consumed by The Slime™️

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,700
then go now in the name of The Pork™️

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,740
for now at least

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,700
the pork is one step ahead of the slime

46
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,808
I'm counting on it
