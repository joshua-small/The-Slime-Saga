1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,780
Councilman

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,820
Thorranbarth

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,168
Omnes Ad Porcos

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:14,820
Omnes Ad Porcos, brother

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,500
what brings you to the Temple of the Shard

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,667
Porkwatch footmen from the Outer Rim

7
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:23,620
have reported a disturbance in the Deadlands

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,740
you don't seem surprised

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,300
tell me Councilman

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,620
has the High Council of the Shard been tampering with the Shadow Gate

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,740
it is much more dire than that I'm afraid

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,580
Brother Braythwaite has ventured to the Realm of Shadows

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,460
High Councilman Ormid approved of this

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,780
he planned on going himself

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,300
but Brother Braythwaite has a history with the Shadow Lord

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,620
we thought it best that he negotiate with Gorlock

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,415
where is Ormis now

18
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:05,660
he's gone to the Shrine

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,960
should the Shard call to him

20
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:09,620
he desires to be close

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,380
it's best we not disturb him

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,620
I'll speak candidly, Tyrrill

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,260
I don't find within myself much trust for the High Council of the Shard

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,860
given that the Lord of the Slime™️ still holds a seat at the table

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,360
yes

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,660
I've expressed these very concerns from the beginning

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,820
you're the youngest on the council

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,680
you once served the Pork proudly

29
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,700
and now you answer to the Shard

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,180
but tell me this

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,380
do you trust your fellow councilmen

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,420
with my life

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,683
then brace yourself

34
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:55,220
because I've made a startling discovery

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,260
what do you mean

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,900
I went into the Porkives to see what I could find on the Lord of the Slime

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,700
but my search unearthed records that I'd never seen before

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,980
the high councilman is not who you think he is

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,980
this can't be true

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm afraid it is

41
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,957
Brother Ormid

42
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,144
was born

43
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,367
in the Slime Realm
