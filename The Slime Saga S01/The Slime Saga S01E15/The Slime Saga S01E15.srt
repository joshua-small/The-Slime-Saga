1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,854
Slime Lord has been in possession of the Shadow Stone

2
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,380
for seven years

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,740
before I gave him the stone

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,220
the shadows spoke to me

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,980
what did they say

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,740
they told me only of things within the gloom and the murk

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,460
liars and cheats

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,100
thieves and scoundrels

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,940
death and decay

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,789
then the Lord of the Slimeâ„¢ offered you

11
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,688
her

12
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:49,906
Maywynn

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,420
he said I would feel her embrace again

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,460
but he never returned

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,999
seven years I've sat here

16
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:06,260
rotting in the shadows

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,860
awaiting her glow

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,260
I see now the tapestry unfurling before me

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,660
it was Slime Lord who refused to sign the Accords

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,820
Accords that would have sealed the Shadow Gate forever

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,100
but he wanted to get to you

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,780
he is a viper

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,860
he speaks with a tongue of fire

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,470
free me from this prison

25
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:47,060
and I'll destroy him myself

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,260
you know I cannot

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,900
grateful as I am for your knowledge

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,700
it will not save you

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,081
then promise me

30
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:02,220
you will save Maywynn

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,540
when the Slime War is over

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,260
all will be saved

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,060
very well

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,460
just tell me how

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,431
how the man whose heart beats for Maywynn

36
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,420
could raise the army of a thousand Jeremys

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,340
I did it for her

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,420
men from your realm came in the night

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,820
they took everything

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,260
you'd have done the same

41
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:46,414
who were these men
