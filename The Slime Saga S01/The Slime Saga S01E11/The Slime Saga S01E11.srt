1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,660
the trek to the Shadow Gate is a three day affair

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,060
I fear that Slimelord may be well ahead of us by then

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,260
I'll not rely on my boots for this journey

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,740
the Eye of Zaranthril

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,660
Brother Braythwaite

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,780
perhaps it would be unwise to bring a third Nether-Gem right to the Slimelord

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,780
we've no choice dear brother

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,380
time is ticking as The Slime™️ is thickening

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,660
once you cross into the realm of shadows

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,820
you'll have no backing

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,460
not from the Council of the Shard

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,420
not from the Porkwatch

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,160
if you've not returned in an hour's time

14
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:48,220
dear Braythwaite

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,340
we will light the fires of Porkfort and send all its footmen to Shadow's Gate

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,220
it must be so

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,340
it is what the Shard demands

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,960
then by the power of the Shard

19
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:05,540
you shall prevail

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,780
go with the Shard on your side

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,940
by the power of Zaranthril

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,860
take me now to the realm of shadows

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,980
I fear that death awaits him

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,620
it must be so brother to him

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,260
or The Slime™️ awaits us all

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,100
hello Gorlock

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,500
do you know me

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,900
you go by many names

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,740
"Light-Bringer"

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,660
"the Scythe of Tharnak

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,420
Braythwaite

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,300
I can smell the Shard on your robes

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,660
we've no time for pleasantries

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,700
I've come for Slimelord

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,410
don't ever mention that name again
