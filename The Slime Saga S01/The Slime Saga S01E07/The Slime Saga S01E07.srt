1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,520
thank you for agreeing to meet me here

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:03,700
High Councilman

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,460
The Council of the Shard relies on the Porkwatch

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,440
the Watch should be able to rely on the Council

5
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:12,940
that we can, Ormid

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,620
at least in my experience

7
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:19,872
last I checked, the Darkwoods did not fall under the Porkwatch's jurisdiction

8
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:21,992
why are we here

9
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:24,737
that it doesn't, Ormid

10
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:27,272
but some conversations that require discretion

11
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:32,552
and there's no place quite as discreet as these Dark Woods

12
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:34,672
all right Thorranbarth

13
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:36,392
you've got my attention

14
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:38,692
as you are well aware

15
00:00:38,693 --> 00:00:40,072
three nights ago

16
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:43,652
gentlemen identified as members of the Slimeguard

17
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:46,232
attempted to steal the Crown of Elgnar

18
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:50,132
my understanding is they've been thrown into the Porkhold

19
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,112
pending a further investigation by the Porkwatch

20
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,210
aye

21
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:57,790
but this morning we found the cells empty

22
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,150
they've escaped

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,630
I'm not so sure it was an escape, councilman

24
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,710
the locks have not been tampered with and the hinges are intact

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,430
are you suggesting the Porkwatch has been compromised

26
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,850
I'm not suggesting anything

27
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:16,290
high Councilman

28
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,070
I only relay what my eyes have seen

29
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,910
is there a Man of the Pork that you've deemed untrustworthy

30
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,150
not until this morning when I saw those bare cells

31
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,001
who's your suspect, Thorranbarth

32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,200
we've got new blood on the Watch

33
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,472
a young lad who joined after the harvest

34
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:39,280
when his father sold off his snail farm

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,360
and you think him untrustworthy

36
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,640
no one's laid eyes on him for two nights

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,780
I just checked his father's house

38
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:49,220
up the ridge

39
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:52,880
and he's not seen him since last night when he left in a hurry

40
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,960
does he have any known affiliates

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,540
someone he might be working with 

42
00:01:58,541 --> 00:01:59,600
or for

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,020
I've not seen him in the company of questionable characters myself

44
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:04,520
Ormid

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,640
but there's a feeling I can't quite shake

46
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,200
I mentioned his father sold off his snail farm

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,720
that was some time ago

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,800
but last time I saw the lad

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,240
there was a residue on his robes

50
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,240
far to be it for me to point fingers

51
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,600
especially at members of the High Council of the Shard

52
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,040
but tell me this, brother Ormid

53
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,020
when's the last time you saw

54
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,392
Slimelord
