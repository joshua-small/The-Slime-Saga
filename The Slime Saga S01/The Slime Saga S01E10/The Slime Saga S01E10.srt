1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,740
I just spoke with Thorranbarth of the Porkwatch

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,180
and as I predicted the Slimguard has seized yet another ancient relic

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,200
the Blade?

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,140
the Heart of Asloendrath

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,500
by Plaraxar's claw

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,940
forgive me brothers

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,120
by the power of the Shard

8
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:24,220
we are meant to see all things

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,620
but I fear I have become blind

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,500
we've no time to wallow Brother Ormid

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,400
Brother Braythwaite

12
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:35,540
we must hasten our descent into the Shadow Realm

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,100
Brother Tyrrill is correct

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,740
we've no time to dwell on the mistakes of the past

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,100
presently

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,300
Slime Lord is negotiating with Gorlock for the release of the Shadow Stone

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,880
and if he's been successful

18
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:51,740
he now possesses two of the Nether-Gems

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,860
we must act immediately or the realm will surely be lost

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,900
bring me my sword

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,420
no

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,980
what do you mean no

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,340
a battle will do no good in this realm or the realm of shadows

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,180
the Lord of the Sime™️ is preparing for battle

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,500
Brother Braythwaite

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,460
we must come armed with more than words

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,900
look at me lads

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,440
did I not withdraw the Heart of Asloendrath from the cave of the Great Dragon 

29
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:35,460
Plaraxar

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,600
you did

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,580
was it not I that fought in the Battle of a Thousand Jeremys

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,260
it was

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,980
and was it not I under the rule of his Majesty King Elgnar

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,620
that the Dark Lord Gorlock was banished to the Shadow Realm in the first place

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,020
yes dear brother

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,100
I may wear silver hair today

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,260
but I assure you my spirit is as strong as dwarven steel

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,940
the deepest lines on my body are not from age

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,380
they are scars

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,700
forgive us dear brother

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,720
go forth brother

42
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:22,540
Braythwaite

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,660
with the power of the Shard on your side

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,100
it would appear the Slime War has begun
