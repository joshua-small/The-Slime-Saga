1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,460
it's no use Thurandrar

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,920
I have the Robanduthrix Crystal

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,533
without it you can't draw your power from the Shadow Realm

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,440
except I have the Jewel of Grendulem 

5
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:14,040
which allows me to travel between realms

6
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,380
including the Shadow Realm

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,080
but that's useless

8
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:18,887
unless you have

9
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:20,720
the Bibbulin Crystal

10
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:25,980
which allows me to access the power of any adjacent realm remotely

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,560
but you're forgetting one thing Thurandrar

12
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,320
it's impossible to wield two power crystals

13
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:31,951
unless you have

14
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:33,820
The eye of Krizzenthus 

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,520
which allows me to wield multiple power crystals at the same time

16
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,229
impossible

17
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,280
that crystal was forged in the Shadow Realm

18
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:44,458
the only way you'd have access to it is if you had

19
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:46,620
the Robanduthrix Crystal

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,180
this entire time

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,520
but that's impossible

22
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,700
I have the Robanduthrix Crystal

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,160
the only way you can deceive me into thinking I didn't

24
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:55,900
is if you had

25
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:57,840
the Jewel of Snabe

26
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:01,980
which allows me to cast a projection of any power crystal

27
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,360
no

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,572
noooo

29
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:08,580
do not fret my child

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,030
you shall forget this entire interaction once I call on the power

31
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:16,165
of Rendubreeb's Ruby
