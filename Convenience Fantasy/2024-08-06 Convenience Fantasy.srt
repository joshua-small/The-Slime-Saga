1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,380
the gate has been sealed

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,580
we're too late

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,460
I am sorry little one

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,940
you're a wizard

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,420
isn't there something you can do

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,460
I'm afraid there are things even my magic cannot do

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,380
I really thought I could save her

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,740
perhaps in time we will understand all things

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,500
before my father died he left me this stone

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,700
I still don't know what it means

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,500
but he used to say a true hero doesn't see with his eyes

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,500
sees with his heart

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,780
then perhaps you should look again

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,040
huh

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,000
huh

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,460
the Eye of Zaranthril

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,220
he who possesses it can pass between worlds

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,700
perhaps we can save your friend after all
