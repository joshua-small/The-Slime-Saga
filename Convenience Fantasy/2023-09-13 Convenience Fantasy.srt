1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,740
It's no use, kronar.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,940
I have the dragon stone.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,900
It's over. You think? In death I am defeated. I am death.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,220
I am ash and mold,

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,980
shadow and dust.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,640
Hear my voice in the shouting of ravens.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,100
I am the lesion and the disease.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,660
I walk between the moonbeams.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,280
I dance between two stones.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,960
In death, I become death.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,220
I am darkness.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,820
And the darkness is everywhere.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,300
Like inside a butt.

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,800
What? It's dark in a butt?

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,920
No, yes, no, yes, no.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,720
How would you know?

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,300
Are you in a butt? No.
