1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,380
he's gone

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,020
I am sorry my child

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,340
isn't there something you can do

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,225
you're a wizard

5
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:16,340
I'm afraid there are things that even magic cannot do

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,020
unless

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,820
unless what

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,500
the Heart of Asloendgrath

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,660
a jewel forged in the crystal waters of the Greldulan Sea

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,700
made from the tear of the great dragon Plaraxnar

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,260
can it save him

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,500
they say it can bring light to the darkest shadow

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,740
where is it

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,808
I'm afraid it's a secret lost to time

15
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,780
if my father was here he would know what to do

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,460
he navigated the seas using only this compass

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,320
wait

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,398
the Heart of Asloendgrath
